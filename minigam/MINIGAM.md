# MINIGAM — RULES

## Equipment
A quarter backgammon board (6 points per side) and 2 dice.

Each player has 8 checkers and a bar.

Players move in opposite directions. For one player, the points are numbered 1 → 6; for the other, 6 → 1.

## Setup
All 8 checkers for each player begin on that player’s bar.

## Object of the Game
Bear off all 8 checkers.

## Movement
On their turn a player rolls two dice.

Each die is a separate move. A player may move one checker twice (in the chosen die order) or move two different checkers.

Doubles count as two equal moves (no extra moves).

## Entering from the Bar
A checker on the bar may enter using a die that corresponds to an open point in that player’s entry direction.

A checker enters onto the point that matches a die, counted from that player’s entry side.

Entry is allowed only onto an open point (empty or containing a single opposing checker).

A checker cannot enter onto an opponent’s made point (a point with two or more opposing checkers).

Entering onto an opposing blot hits it and places it on the opponent’s bar.

## Movement and Hitting
Landing on an opposing blot sends it to the opponent’s bar.

A made point is any point with two or more of a player’s checkers; opponents may not enter onto or land on it.

## Forced Moves
If at least one die yields a legal move, the player must make a legal move.

The player may choose the die order. The player is not required to use both dice; they may choose an order that results in only one die being played even if another order would allow both.

If neither die can be played, the turn ends with no move.

## Bearing Off
A checker may bear off only with an exact roll matching the distance from its point to the exit.

A checker may enter from the bar and bear off in the same turn if both moves are legal.

## Winning
The first player to bear off all 8 checkers wins.

## Variant: Full-Entry Requirement

A player may not bear off any checker until all 8 of that player’s checkers are on the board (none on the bar).
All other rules remain the same.
