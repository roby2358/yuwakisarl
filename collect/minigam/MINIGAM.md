MINIGAM — RULES

Equipment
A quarter backgammon board (6 points per side) and 2 dice.
Each player has 8 checkers and a bar.
Players move in opposite directions. For one player, the points are numbered 1 → 6; for the other, 6 → 1.

Setup
All 8 checkers for each player begin on that player’s bar.

Object of the Game
Bear off all 8 checkers.

Entering from the Bar
A checker on the bar must enter before any other checker is moved.
A checker enters onto the point that matches a die roll, counting from that player’s entry side.
A checker may only enter onto an open point (empty or containing a single opposing checker).
A checker cannot enter onto an opponent’s made point (a point with two or more opposing checkers).
Both dice may be used to enter different checkers if legal.

Movement
On a turn, the player rolls two dice.
Each die shows a separate move. A player may move one checker twice (in die order) or two different checkers.
If a checker lands on an opposing blot (a point with exactly one opposing checker), the blot is hit and placed on the opponent’s bar.
If one die can be played, the player must play it. The other die may be played only if legal.

Made Points
A point with two or more of a player’s own checkers is a made point.
The opponent may not land on or enter onto a made point.

Bearing Off
A checker may bear off only with an exact roll matching the distance from its current point to the exit.
A checker may enter from the bar and bear off in the same turn if both moves are legal.

Winning
The first player to bear off all 8 checkers wins.

Variant: Full-Entry Requirement

Before a player may bear off any checker, all 8 of that player’s checkers must be on the board (none on the bar).
All other rules remain the same.
