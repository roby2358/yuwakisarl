Extend `NeuralPolicyAgent` to support discounted or n-step returns by retaining short trajectories (not just the last action) so rewards propagate across sequences, and add unit tests that fail under the current single-step trace.

Introduce an agent-sharing mechanism in `AIController` (or update documentation/tests) so AI-controlled players can optionally share a single learner instance when desired, preventing divergence from the RL guide.

Remove the zero-activation overwrite in NeuralPolicyAgent.learn and replace it with a mathematically correct gradient handling strategy, backed by a regression test.

Surface episode termination to AI-controlled agents so TD bootstrapping is disabled when a round resets, and cover the boundary case with controller/game loop tests.

Audit `RL.md` against the current `Observation` encoding and update the documentation (or the encoder) so that the described features match the nine-value vector that agents actually receive.

Update `CollectPufferAgent.learn` to bootstrap value targets with the next state (or a configurable discount), instead of ignoring `next_state`, and cover the change with unit tests.

ID: rlfix-aia8
Fix `NeuralPolicyAgent.learn` so backprop uses the pre-update weight matrices when computing hidden-layer deltas, and add a regression unit test that fails with the current in-place update order.
